# Help A Paw

Help a Paw is a free mobile application that let's you send emergency signals about animals in need. As a result volunteers nearby (app users just like you!) will receive a notification and could provide help.

## Getting Started

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app][Code Lab]
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples][Cookbook]

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation][Flutter], which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
